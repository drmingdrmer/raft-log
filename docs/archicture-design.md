# Architecture Design for the "raft-log" Repository

The "raft-log" repository is a Rust implementation of a write-ahead log (WAL) designed for use in Raft, a consensus algorithm for distributed systems. The architecture is modular, emphasizing separation of concerns, data integrity, and performance optimization through efficient storage management and caching mechanisms.

## Overview

The repository is structured into several key modules and components:

1. **Configuration Management (`config.rs`):** Handles configuration parameters and utilities for file naming and parsing.
2. **Chunk Management (`chunk.rs`):** Manages log chunks, both active and sealed, facilitating efficient disk I/O.
3. **State Management (`state.rs`, `raft_log_state.rs`):** Maintains the state of the log, including vote information and log indices.
4. **Record Handling (`record.rs`):** Defines the structure and serialization/deserialization of log records.
5. **Cache Management (`log_cache.rs`):** Implements an in-memory cache for quick access to recent log entries.
6. **Raft Log Core (`raft_log.rs`):** The central component orchestrating interactions between modules.
7. **Concurrency Control (`lock_file.rs`):** Ensures exclusive access to the log directory to prevent data corruption.
8. **Utilities and Helpers:** Includes modules for error definitions, number formatting, and offset tracking.
9. **Testing Infrastructure (`tests/`):** Contains unit tests and utilities to ensure correctness and reliability.
10. **Command-Line Tool (`src/bin/dump.rs`):** Provides a utility for inspecting the contents of the log.

Below is a detailed exploration of each component and their interactions within the system.

---

## 1. Configuration Management (`config.rs`)

**Responsibilities:**

- Define and manage configuration parameters for the Raft log system.
- Provide utilities for constructing file paths and parsing chunk file names.

**Key Features:**

- **Config Struct:** Holds configuration options such as directory paths, cache sizes (`log_cache_max_items`, `log_cache_capacity`), buffer sizes (`read_buffer_size`), chunk management parameters (`max_records`, `max_size`), and data integrity options (`truncate_incomplete_record`).
- **File Naming Conventions:** Generates and parses chunk file names using a consistent and sortable format based on chunk IDs.

---

## 2. Chunk Management (`chunk.rs`)

**Responsibilities:**

- Handle storage and retrieval of log records within chunk files on disk.
- Manage active and sealed chunks to optimize write and read operations.

**Key Components:**

- **Chunk Struct:**
  - Represents a chunk file containing a sequence of log records.
  - Manages file I/O operations, offsets, and synchronization.
- **ActiveChunk:**
  - The current chunk where new log records are appended.
  - Monitors size and record count to determine when to seal.
- **SealedChunk:**
  - A read-only chunk that has been sealed (no further writes).
  - Retains the state of the log at the time of sealing for recovery purposes.

**Functionality:**

- **Appending Records:** Writes new records to the active chunk, updating offsets and ensuring data is flushed to disk.
- **Sealing Chunks:** When a chunk reaches its size or record count limit, it is sealed, and a new active chunk is created.
- **Reading Records:** Provides methods to read records by offset, handling both active and sealed chunks transparently.

---

## 3. State Management (`state.rs`, `raft_log_state.rs`)

**Responsibilities:**

- Maintain the current state of the Raft log, including voting information and indices of the last, committed, and purged log entries.
- Apply state transitions based on log record operations.

**Key Components:**

- **RaftLogState Struct:**
  - Tracks important log indices (`last`, `committed`, `purged`) and the current vote.
  - Provides methods to update state while enforcing consistency rules (e.g., preventing vote or log ID reversals).
- **State Machine Trait (`state_machine.rs`):**
  - Defines an interface for applying log records to the state.
  - Implemented by `RaftLogSM` to process records and update the `RaftLogState`.

**Data Integrity:**

- Enforces rules to prevent inconsistencies, such as:
  - **Vote Reversal:** Rejects attempts to update the vote to an earlier term.
  - **Log ID Reversal:** Prevents appending log IDs that are less than the current `last` log ID.
  - **Non-Consecutive Log IDs:** Ensures log IDs are contiguous unless explicitly truncated.

---

## 4. Record Handling (`record.rs`)

**Responsibilities:**

- Define the structure of different types of log records.
- Serialize and deserialize records for storage and transmission.

**Record Types:**

- **SaveVote:** Records a vote with term and candidate information.
- **Append:** Adds a new log entry with a log ID and payload.
- **Commit:** Marks a log entry as committed.
- **TruncateAfter:** Truncates the log after a specified log ID.
- **PurgeUpto:** Removes log entries up to a specified log ID.
- **State:** Captures the entire `RaftLogState` for recovery.

**Serialization:**

- Implements the `Encode` and `Decode` traits.
- Utilizes checksums (`ChecksumWriter` and `ChecksumReader`) to ensure data integrity during serialization and deserialization.

---

## 5. Cache Management (`log_cache.rs`)

**Responsibilities:**

- Provide an in-memory cache for recent log entries to optimize read performance.
- Implement cache eviction policies based on size and item count.

**Features:**

- **LogCache Struct:**
  - Stores log entries in a `BTreeMap` for ordered access.

- **Eviction Policy:**
  - Removes the oldest entries when exceeding `max_items` or `capacity`.
  - Ensures the cache remains within configured resource constraints.

---

## 6. Raft Log Core (`raft_log.rs`)

**Responsibilities:**

- Serve as the central orchestrator of the Raft log system.
- Manage interactions between the state machine, WAL, chunk management, and caching.

**Implementations:**

  - Implements `RaftLogWriter` trait, providing methods for:
    - `save_vote`
    - `append`
    - `truncate`
    - `purge`
    - `commit`
    - `sync`
  - Maintains instances of `RaftLogWAL` and `RaftLogSM` for WAL operations and state management.
- **Data Flow:**
  - **Appending Entries:** Writes to the active chunk and updates the state machine.
  - **Reading Entries:** Retrieves from cache if available; otherwise, reads from the appropriate chunk.
  - **Synchronization:** Ensures all writes are flushed to disk using the `sync` method.

**Error Handling:**

- Propagates errors from underlying components.
- Provides detailed error messages with context to aid in debugging.

---

## 7. Concurrency Control (`lock_file.rs`)

**Responsibilities:**

- Prevent concurrent access to the log directory by multiple processes.
- Ensure data integrity by enforcing exclusive file locks.

**Mechanism:**

- **LockFile Struct:**
  - Creates and maintains a lock file using file system locks (`fs2::FileExt`).
  - Releases the lock when the `LockFile` instance is dropped.

**Use Cases:**

- **Process Isolation:** Ensures that only one instance of the application is interacting with the log at any time.

## Explanation

### In-Memory Data Structures

- **RaftLogState (`RaftLogState`):**
  - Maintains the state of the Raft log, including:
    - `vote`: The current term and candidate voted for.
    - `last`: The ID of the last log entry appended.
    - `committed`: The ID of the last committed log entry.
    - `purged`: The ID of the last purged log entry.
  - Ensures that operations maintain the consistency and integrity of the log state.

- **LogCache (`log_cache.rs`):**
  - An in-memory cache for recently accessed log entries.
  - Implemented as a `BTreeMap` of `LogId` to `LogPayload`.
  - Improves read performance by caching frequently accessed entries.
  - Enforces size constraints to prevent excessive memory usage.

- **RaftLogSM (`raft_log_sm.rs`):**
  - The state machine responsible for applying log records to the `RaftLogState`.
  - Processes records like `Append`, `Commit`, `TruncateAfter`, and `PurgeUpto`.
  - Ensures that state transitions are valid and that the `RaftLogState` remains consistent.

- **LogData (`log_data.rs`):**
  - Stores metadata about log entries.
  - Implemented as a `BTreeMap` mapping log indices to `LogData` objects.
  - Each `LogData` includes:
    - `log_id`: Unique identifier for the log entry.
    - `chunk_id`: Identifier of the chunk where the log entry resides.
    - `record_segment`: Byte offset and length of the record within the chunk file.

- **RaftLogWAL (`raft_log_wal.rs`):**
  - Manages write-ahead logging functionality.
  - Handles the writing of log records to disk.
  - Manages:
    - **ActiveChunk:**
      - The current chunk file being written to.
      - Contains a `Chunk` object with file handles and offset tracking.
      - Holds a write buffer for accumulating records before flushing to disk.
    - **SealedChunks:**
      - Completed chunks that are read-only.
      - No further records are appended to these chunks.
      - Retained for reading and replaying log entries.

- **LockFile (`lock_file.rs`):**
  - Ensures exclusive access to the log directory by the process.
  - Prevents concurrent processes from modifying the log simultaneously.
  - Acquired when the `RaftLog` is instantiated and released upon its drop.

### On-Disk Data Structures

- **Lock File:**
  - A file named `"LOCK"` located in the log directory.
  - Used to enforce exclusive access to the log by the process.

- **Chunk Files (`chunk.rs`):**
  - Stored in the log directory with filenames like `r-<chunk_id>.wal`.
    - `<chunk_id>` is a formatted numerical identifier.
  - Two types of chunk files:
    - **Active Chunk File:**
      - The file currently being written to.
      - Corresponds to the `ActiveChunk` in memory.
    - **Sealed Chunk Files:**
      - Read-only files that contain previously written log records.
      - Correspond to the `SealedChunks` in memory.
  - Each chunk file contains:
    - **Offsets:**
      - An array of byte offsets marking the boundaries of records within the file.
    - **Log Records:**
      - Serialized `Record` objects, including:
        - State records (`Record::State`)
        - Append records (`Record::Append`)
        - Commit records (`Record::Commit`)
        - Truncate and purge records

### Data Flow and Interactions

1. **Appending Log Entries:**

   - **Write Path:**
     1. **API Invocation:**
        - The application calls the `append` method on the `RaftLog` API with new log entries.
     2. **Record Creation:**
        - Each log entry is wrapped in a `Record::Append` object.
     3. **ActiveChunk Write:**
        - Records are serialized and written to the `ActiveChunk`'s write buffer.
        - When the buffer reaches a certain size, it is flushed to the active chunk file on disk.
     4. **State Machine Update:**
        - The `RaftLogSM` applies the records to update the `RaftLogState`.
        - The `LogData` map is updated with metadata about the new entries.
     5. **Chunk Management:**
        - If the `ActiveChunk` exceeds configured limits (size or record count), it is sealed.
        - A new `ActiveChunk` is created, and the process repeats.

2. **Reading Log Entries:**

   - **Read Path:**
     1. **Cache Lookup:**
        - The `LogCache` is checked first for the requested entries.
     2. **Cache Miss Handling:**
        - If not in cache, the `LogData` map provides the `chunk_id` and `record_segment` for each entry.
     3. **Disk Access:**
        - The appropriate chunk file (active or sealed) is accessed.
        - The log record is read from the file using the offset and length.
     4. **Cache Update:**
        - The retrieved entry may be added to the `LogCache` for future accesses.

3. **Sealing Chunks:**

   - **When Chunks Are Sealed:**
     - Conditions like reaching a maximum number of records or file size trigger the sealing.
     - The `ActiveChunk`:
       - Flushes any remaining data to disk.
       - Updates its metadata and becomes read-only (`SealedChunk`).
     - A new `ActiveChunk` is initialized for subsequent writes.

4. **State Updates:**

   - **Applying Records:**
     - Operations such as `commit`, `truncate`, or `purge` generate respective records.
     - These records are processed by the `RaftLogSM`, which updates the `RaftLogState`.

5. **Synchronization:**

   - **Data Durability:**
     - The `sync` method ensures that all in-memory buffers are flushed to disk.
     - Calls `fsync` on chunk files to guarantee data persistence.

### Interactions Between Components

- **RaftLog API and RaftLog Struct:**
  - Provides the interface for the application to interact with the log.
  - Delegates operations to the underlying components.

- **RaftLogSM (State Machine):**
  - Validates and applies log records.
  - Ensures the `RaftLogState` remains consistent with the log operations.

- **RaftLogWAL (Write-Ahead Log):**
  - Manages the writing of log records to disk.
  - Handles chunk creation, sealing, and file synchronization.

- **LogCache and LogData:**
  - Work together to provide efficient read access to log entries.
  - The cache reduces disk I/O, while `LogData` maintains the mapping between log indices and records on disk.

- **LockFile:**
  - Operates independently to control access to the log directory.
  - Ensures that the integrity of the log is not compromised by concurrent processes.
